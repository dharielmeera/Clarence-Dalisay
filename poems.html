<p> This poem holds my feeling to the girl whom I loved but then leave me for another man. 
He fell in love with someone no matter we are still in a relationship. </p>
<p> And I give this a title named </p>
<h1> THANKYOU, NEXT </h1>
<p> I </p>
<p style= "font-family: Arial; color: red"> Just like a game in a CUP</p>
<p> A fishbone picking?</p>
<p> The one whom she holds up</p>
<p> Has better chances of winning</p>
<p>II</p>
<p style= "font-family: Arial; color: red"> Saying Thankyou in our memory</p>
<p> Destroys my heart that easily</p>
<p> And next month after that</p>
<p> You cares for new man, shit damn "what?"</p>
<p> III </p>
<p style= "font-family: Arial; color: red"> Just to think that you fooled me </p>
<p> Drops tears like leaves in a tree</p>
<p> My sorrow, loneliness my dear </p>
<p> Still too deep for three consecutive years </p>
<p> IV </p>
<p style= "font-family: Arial; color: red"> But then thankyou, for those moments </p>
<p> It was unforgettable, and a valued presents </p>
<p> Indeed promise, the next time I love </p>
<p> Good lessons I learned, will surely use and adapt </p>
