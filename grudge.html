<p> This work shows my emotions of hatred and pain the first day we met and talk after the break up. It's a 3 years old poem actually.  </p>
<h1> Grudge </h1>
<p>I waited for you like a fool </p>
<p>Like a lunatic without any pride </p>
<p>I hate myself for waiting for you </p>
<p>You deceived me </p>
<p>I hate myself for anticipating </p>
<p>And worrying why you did not show up </p>
<p>How silly must you think I am? </p>
<p>Did you say that because now I knew? </p>
<p>If you were going to lie  </p>
<p>At least don't get caught </p>
<p>You shouldn't have gotten caught ever </p>
<p>I can endure the pain </p>
<p>And act that I do not know anything </p>
<p>Now you're sorry, for what? What did you do? </p>
<p>For pretending and duping me? </p>
<p>Is that what you're sorry about? </p>
<p>You knew how I feel, you felt it </p>
<p>What did you think  </p>
<p>While you saw me and felt all that? </p>
<p>What were you thingking  </p>
<p>As you watched me telling you </p>
<p>That I love you </p>
<p>And yes, on the day I cry, in front of you </p>
<p>What a fool you must've thought I was? </p>
<p>Was it fun? </p>
<p>How much fun did you have? </p>
<p>How much did you laugh at me </p>
<p>For falling for it?` </p>
<p>How is it if you knew how I felt? </p>
<p>How could you do this to me </p>
<p>Did you feel anything for me, </p>
<p>For even a second? </p>
<p>Every second I'm with you, terrefies me now </p>
<p>I want to forget them all </p>
<p>I want them all to disappear </p>
<p>So get out </p>
<p>Get out of my life Forever </p>
